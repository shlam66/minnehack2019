        <h1 className="title">Why Hemp?</h1>

        The plant has over 25,000 known uses and is 
        potentially an eco-friendly alternative for 
        other crops commonly produced on an industrial scale. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Hemp is often attributed with miraculous potential 
        for sequestering carbon, reducing agricultural 
        pollution, and allowing farmers to make large 
        profits on marginal land. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        A recent Cornell University analysis found that 
        profits ranged from roughly $130 to $730 per 
        acre â€“ comparable to most grain crops on the lower 
        end and approaching high-value vegetable crops on 
        the upper end.
