                    The plant has over 25,000 known uses and is 
                    potentially an eco-friendly alternative for 
                    other crops commonly produced on an industrial scale. 
                    It grows quickly, the plant will reach ~12 inches in 
                    approximately 3-4 weeks. Growing hemp is rapidly 
                    expanding: in 2016 there was 10,000 acres grown in the 
                    U.S. whereas in 2017 there was 26,000 acres grown.

                    Hemp is often attributed with miraculous potential 
                    for sequestering carbon, reducing agricultural 
                    pollution, and allowing farmers to make large 
                    profits on marginal land. It is naturally resistant to 
                    most pests, grows in tight conditions reducing land needed,
                    and can grow in a variety of climates.

                    A recent Cornell University analysis found that 
                    profits ranged from roughly $130 to $730 per 
                    acre â€“ comparable to most grain crops on the lower 
                    end and approaching high-value vegetable crops on 
                    the upper end.

                    Hemp is rapidly expanding and there is little 
                    information on the best strategies and practices 
                    for growing hemp. Hemptations goal aims towards 
                    informing farmers of the best growing methods.
